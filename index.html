       <h2>Languages</h2>
       <p>
        My goal is to speak as many languages as I can. Currently, I speak 2 languages : French and English. I've been learning spanish for 6 years. I started learning Italian and German recently. I am pretty good with technology, espacially with Excel and Word.

       <h3>My hobbies</h3>
       <p>
        I practice horse riding for 13 years and i have my own horse. I did many jumping competitions when I was younger. But it's been 5 years that I practise only dressage.
        About a year ago, I discovered Formula 1 and I like it a lot. This summer I'm going to my first GrandPrix.

      <h5>Travel</h5>
      <p> I love travelling. I didn't travel much outside of France but I travelled a lot in the south of France. Since I'm 2 or 3 years old, ever summer, with my family, we go in different cities. I went in Uzès, Montpellier, Toulouse, Nice, Lyon. Then I went once in Rhodes, an island in Greece. Whith my school I did an amazing trip in Bulgaria during 15 days. I went in Rome when I was 13 years old. My next trip is going to be in Barcelona during the spring holidays. Then for this summer, I have planned a trip to Italy, Austria and Germany with my family.
